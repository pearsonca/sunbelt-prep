\section*{Abstract}
We outline the problem of testing and validating strategies for detecting clandestine groups with network approaches.  As practical example, we specify a graph-based model of populace-wide communications, with an embedded, relatively small module representing a clandestine group.  The members of this group behave similarly to the background population, except that they also pass special messages in furtherance of a plan.\todoCP{{\em would like to say:} We parametrize this model based on cell phone data sets.}

Using simulated message traffic on this network and various detection strategies, we demonstrate application of various traditional performance measures, e.g. Receiver Operator Characteristic.  We also extend these measures to have bands based on model uncertainty derived from parameter uncertainty (e.g., in the features of the general population, the clandestine group, their respective communication behaviors).

\todoCP{{\em I think not for this round, but maybe:} Finally, we consider the implications of {\em forged} messages.  In the basic model, we consider incomplete information about the communications, but the available information is always accurate.  In this extension, we allow the Observer and the clandestine group to forge messages.  We again measure various Observer performance traits relative to properties of the observed network.}

\section*{Introduction}
For investigators ranging from anthropologists to law enforcement, the need to identify groups which wish to remain anonymous is be paramount.  In particular, the need for intelligence organizations to identify terrorist cells and defuse their violent plots is a matter of increasing import.

These categorization efforts are fed on a diet of so-called ``Big Data'' -- amounts of data so large, turning over at a rate so fast, that human analyst team cannot pragmatically digest it directly.  Hence, the need for some computer-based, heuristic filtration.  We avoid using ``algorithmic'' at this point; that would imply a false certainty about patterns in the phenomena, and the stability of those phenomena, associated with these investigations.

As such, what these filters call for is testing and validation.  Calling field testing ``problematic'' seems like a gross understatement; reference ``truth'' is either non-existent or deceptive, and running experiments has dangerous side effects.  Even making use of intensely studied historical events is problematic: these offer no way to consider tactical and strategic innovations, assuming the historical data are even accurate.

Generating synthetic data seems like the obvious alternative.  It allows for comparison across detection strategies, experimentation with the clandestine group's tactics, forecasting of risks and tradeoffs in a way that allows uncertainties, and in general providing a framework for situational assessment.  However, such a tool has subtle downsides; if one believes a particular strategy is effective -- perhaps even with reasonable evidence for a particular time and situation -- the would be a natural tendency to ``adjust'' scenarios until they indicated the success of strategy.

In the following sections, we layout the uses and abuses of such a framework.  What makes for useful synthetic data sets? What are the appropriate measures for detection strategies on them?  We motivate that discussion by referencing a simple model of terrorism -- the Salafi jihad networks as described by Sageman {\em et al.}\cite{sageman} -- though we will point out where assumptions can be modified to identify different kinds of groups against a background population, since the tactics of these organizations are constantly evolving. 

\section*{Framing a Covert Network Detection Assessment}
The modeling problem requires describing and representing several aspects.
\subsection{General Population \&\ Their Communications}
Most communications pulled in by electronic dragnet will be those of the general populace surrounding the clandestine group.  This is an inevitable outcome of pursuing these groups via this means -- the identity of the clandestine group is, by definition, not known prior to the investigation.  The task is then to distinguish the clandestine group from the general population for non-trivial cases.  What makes the task non-trivial?  The complexity and amount of general traffic make it a computationally non-trivial problem, certainly, but there are also more pernicious theoretical problems.  The target population's structure is initially unknown, as are their communication habits, and may be shifting over the timescale of the investigation -- indeed, possibly in response to the investigation.  With the confirmation of activities by the NSA that were formerly considered to be in the realm of tinfoil haberdashery, the technical elite, and perhaps even the general public, will modify their communications.  Finally, different investigations may have fundamentally different access to communication bands, providing different types of information.

All of that is to say, there is no simple color of ``noise'' that can be analytically filtered away to leave only the clandestine signal.  It may be the case that there will never be such a phenomena.  Acknowledging this, any test of an investigative tool must address this messy background.  This means synthetically generating the background structure and the communications on that structure, and with many different models since it is unlikely that any given approach will validate well against more than a few reasonable measures.

For our motivating example, we generated a background population structure based on the following model:

\begin{itemize}
\item individuals have relationships in three ``dimensions'' - Family, Religious, and Economic
\item ``Communities'' are constructed around the Family and Economic dimensions by assembling a graph from cliques, then cliques of cliques ad nauseum, and finally some random reshuffling.  These dimensions are determined independently
\item The Religious dimension is determined by correlation with the Family dimension shortest paths.  The shorter the path length, the more likely individuals are to connect along the Religious dimension
\end{itemize}

Why those three dimensions?  Why only three?  Why form communities that way?

We do not see data to support fitting graph structural parameters much beyond a single dimension, and adding more parameters introduces the subtle danger of providing too many degrees of freedom.

However, we wished to demonstrate framing the problem with a not-too-simplistic model, and one that has pieces that could be individually measured.  But we emphasize again: the background population is a chameleon.  No strategy should be evaluated against a single model of the background population -- you do not know what mechanism gives rise to that population structure, and the parameters you have for the mechanisms you believe apply are wrong.

This background population then communicates

\subsection{Covert Actors \&\ Their Communications}


\section*{Model}
Sageman, Qin, et al. describe the structure of the Salafi networks as comprising a few key individuals with links to a large group of lieutenants -- the middle management of terror -- that are each connected to several tightly clustered subordinate groups -- terrorist cells -- that execute plots.  The lieutenants typically integrate with the regular population, while the subordinate groups are largely cloistered.

To represent the three components -- the background population, the lieutenants, the subordinate clusters -- we generate the graph from clusters with the features of each of these.  Vertices are people ($\mathbf{P}=\{P_1, P_2, \ldots P_k\}, n(\mathbf{P})=k$), with a directed edge from $P_i$ to $P_j$ if person $i$ initiates communication with person $j$.  Communication takes the form of messages of a simplified sort: a binary ``good'' or ``bad'' signal.  Full instructions from a lieutenant to the subordinate groups that will implement a terrorist event consist of a cumulation of several “bad” signals. Additionally, “bad” signals can be transmitted by anyone in the general population, though these play no role in the plot.

In the following sections, we provide the details of generating the groups, assembling them into a whole, and finally their communication behavior.  For our simulations, we focus on a population that contains a single lieutenant coordinating multiple subordinate clusters, though we acknowledge that more realistic scenarios would typically entail tracking multiple plotting groups.

\subsection*{The Background Population, the $P_{n}\in\mathbf{P}$}
Individuals in the background population are members of multiple communities, divided among multiple dimensions -- e.g., family, religion, work.  Most of these connections are bi-directional.

For our simulation, we assume that each of the background individuals is a member of three independent community ``dimensions''\todoCP{could this assumption be informed? I'm making it for simplicity, but I think its plausible that someone has done research about people's group identities, the extent to which those are non-indepedent, and concluded about the range of independent groups a person can be called a member of}.  We form each of these dimensions by generating community structures according to a community size distribution and formation algorithm, until the total number of vertices in a dimension equals the total population.  We then randomly assign individuals to one single community in each dimension, and then ``flatten'' the resulting graph by merging any edges that are duplicated across dimensions.

To form a community, we sample the size distribution to determine community size.  We then form completely connected triads up to that size, adding the potentially remaining 1 or 2 vertices to triad (or two) and forming a completely connected quartet.  We then take these cliques 3 at a time, and treating them like vertices, form more completely connected triads by choosing a random member for each clique to bidirectionally connect (left over cliques are treated similarly to left over vertices).  This joining proceeds iteratively until there are fewer than three objects at a scale to connect.  We then consider each unjoined pair of vertices and form a directed link with low probability $r_p$.

\subsection*{A Lieutenant, the \Hub\ Vertex}
\Hub\ has community affiliations like most members of the population.  However, \Hub\ is a member of more communities than the typical individual in the population given the need to gather information, identify recruits, etc.  Finally, \Hub\ is completely connected to the members of the clusters, but those connections are only directed from \Hub\ to the cluster members.

\Hub\ is added to a number of communities sampled from a distribution and then randomly connected with members in that community with probability $c_o$ (to that member) and $c_i$ (from that member).  This distribution and these probabilities should be set relative to background population connection structures such that the \Hub\ is a high outlier for both the in and out degree distributions of the population.\footnote{{\bf TODO what distribution? math to enforce prob limits?}}

\subsection*{The Subordinates, $C_i\in\mathbf{C}$}
Each $C_i$ is a bi-direction clique, comprising a small number of individuals.  In our simulations, we sample from a binomial clique size.  The $C_i$ have no other structured communication channels.

\subsection*{Message Passing Behavior}
\Obs\ understands the network by monitoring message traffic between individuals.  For this analysis, we consider messages with binary state only: the message is either ``good'' or ``bad''.

The background population generate these messages according to simplifying assumptions about the real world: they have no preference for their community memberships beyond how many members of a community they connect to, their messaging activity occupies an inconsequential period of time during any iteration, and the iteration time is such that multiple real events (e.g., a few calls between individuals) can be treated as a single continuous event.  Thus, during each iteration, each individual $P_i\notin\C{n}\cap\Hub$ (1) activates its out degrees with probability $\rho_m$ -- {\em i.e.}, a person does a binomial sample of the available channels -- and then (2), $P_i$ sends a single message to each active channel.  These messages are ``bad'' with a low probability $p_b$.

{\bf TODO} equations for $P_i$ outgoing messages, probability of sending a bad one.

Like the $P_i$, \Hub\ abides by the simplifying assumptions about the real world, with one small perturbation.  \Hub\ is a member of many communities, and strategically cultivates and exploits these memberships.  To model that, \Hub\ will send at least one message to each community he is in, and possibly more.  So, for each community \Hub\ is a member of, \Hub\ sends $1+{n\choose k_i-1}$ messages, where $k_i$ is the number of connections \Hub\ has within that community.\footnote{{\bf TODO: good vs. badness of these messages? Original: ``These messages will always be ``good'' messages.'' but certainly if he's actively recruiting, or testing the waters, or looking to gather sensitive intel, etc. these could all be ``bad'' messages.}}

Any given iteration, \Hub\ may also issue directives to the subordinate groups.  These messages will always be ``bad'' messages, but (1) are sent with low probability $h_b$ and (2) are sent to only one member of any particular $C_i$, since any $C_i$ member can be assumed to instantly disperse this information to the others.

{\bf TODO} equations for \Hub\ outgoing messages, probability of sending a bad one.

The members of each $C_i$ are largely ``silent'' -- which is to say, their communication is direct and is largely untraceable.  Rarely, however, they will break their direct communication discipline, or otherwise be observed to interact.  Each iteration, they may communicate with one other member of their $C_i$ (chosen uniformly) with low probability $c_m$; these messages have a relatively high probability of being ``bad'', $c_b$.  If any member of the clique received a message from \Hub\ the previous iteration, one member (chosen uniformly) may communicate a bad message to another $C_j$ (which $j$ chosen uniformly, which member of $C_j$ chosen uniformly) with probability $c_o$.  This models the largely untraceable communication among members in a $C_i$ and between $C_j$'s.

{\bf TODO} equations for $C_i$ outgoing messages.

Finally, there is a low probability $\rho_r$ of an individual sending a random message to an individual they do {\em not} have an outgoing link to each iteration. For each individual that will send one of these messages, they recipient is selected uniformly from the candidate recipients.

{\bf TODO} equation

\section*{Observers}
A particular \Obs, for a particular scenario, only observes the message traffic as it comes along.  \Obs\ does directly see any structural features of the population graph, nor does \Obs\ know certainly when messages are among normal individuals or the plotters, let alone within a particular community.  Different \Obs's may make different assumptions about these features, and use those features to target their monitoring and even adjust their beliefs about those features according to the message traffic that occurs.

For all of the strategies we consider, our \Obs's make some limiting assumptions consistent with those we put in the model, specifically that there is a single \Hub, connected to multiple $C_i$.  The \Obs\ knows that both the plotters and background population can send ``bad'' messages.

Additionally, \Obs\ makes other assumptions about the structure of background communities, the messaging rate of various parties, and other features of the graph.  These assumptions are not necessarily correct, but \Obs\ still makes them as starting guess.

\section*{Results Ignoring Decoys}

\section*{Considering Decoys}
There are two fundamental sorts of deception available in the model: deception by $\Hub\cap\mathbf{C}$ and deception by \Obs.  Deception by the plotters includes sending ``bad'' messages to the background, and, assuming the background is sympathetic, having those bad messages echoed along. Or forging bad messages between members of the background.  Deception by \Obs\ entails forging messages from a false \Hub, in hopes of hitting one of the $C_i$ and seeing them respond accordingly.

\subsection*{Implementation, the DarkNet API, and Extension}
{\bf TODO} description of software package.  where to get source, how to write extensions.  Propose some extensions: give individuals a vocabulary assigned from a distribution, have them randomly assemble messages from the vocabulary, some ``words'' of which are ``bad''.  Allow multiple communication channel types.  Include a community dimension and have ``within community X'' as part of the message information.

%  Our simulation tool allows for multiple edges from one vertex to another, representing multiple avenues of communication, subject to different levels of monitoring.  In these analyses, we do not exploit having multiple edges between individuals, and only use this capability to distinguish between monitored and unmonitored channels.
